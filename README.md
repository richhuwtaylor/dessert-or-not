# Dessert or Not?
A PySpark ML pipeline for working out which attributes of an Epicurious recipe are important in determining whether or not it is a dessert.

Uses the [Epicurious - Recipes with Rating and Nutrition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugodarwood/epirecipes) Kaggle dataset, originally scraped from http://www.epicurious.com/recipes-menus.

### About the data
